# Machine Learning on Coursera

This is part of an independent study in machine learning done in the Spring of 2017 at Olin College of Engineering.

### Running

Each sub-directory should have a `ex#.m` file that matches the sub-directory name. Homework is done in Octave. Each homework assignment instruction is listed as `ex#.pdf`.

To run homework code, make sure that you have Octave installed. In each subdirectory, you can run `ex#` in the Octave console, where `#` is the homework assignment number.

Latter homeworks were submitted as pull requests. View them here:
